ProtonSwap is the decentralized exchange built on XPR Network, and it allows you to swap between wrapped tokens with zero gas fees. In this tutorial, we will walk through swapping xUSDC for xBTC so you can gain Bitcoin exposure directly from your WebAuth.com wallet.

## What Are Wrapped Tokens on Proton?

Wrapped tokens are representations of assets from other blockchains that live on XPR Network. When you deposit USDC or BTC into the Proton bridge, you receive the equivalent wrapped version:

- **xUSDC** is USDC (USD Coin) wrapped on the Proton chain.
- **xBTC** is Bitcoin wrapped on the Proton chain.

These wrapped tokens maintain a 1:1 peg with their native counterparts and can be unwrapped (bridged back) to the original blockchain at any time. The advantage of using wrapped tokens on Proton is that you can trade and transfer them instantly and without fees.

## Connecting Your Wallet

1. Navigate to [ProtonSwap](https://www.protonswap.com) in your browser.
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the top-right corner.
3. Select **WebAuth.com** and approve the connection request on your mobile device.

Once connected, you will see your account name and token balances displayed in the interface.

## Performing the Swap

1. On the swap page, select **xUSDC** as the token you want to sell (the "From" field).
2. Select **xBTC** as the token you want to receive (the "To" field).
3. Enter the amount of xUSDC you wish to swap. The interface will display the estimated amount of xBTC you will receive, along with the current exchange rate and price impact.
4. Review the details. If the price impact is low (under 1% for most trades), you are getting a fair rate.
5. Click **Swap** and confirm the transaction in your WebAuth.com wallet.

The swap executes on-chain in about half a second, and there is no gas fee. The only cost is the standard liquidity pool fee (typically 0.3%), which goes to liquidity providers.

## Checking Your Balance

After the swap completes, your updated xBTC balance will appear in your WebAuth.com wallet under the tokens list. You can also verify the transaction by searching your account name on [protonscan.io](https://www.protonscan.io), which shows a full history of all your on-chain activity.

From here, you can hold your xBTC, swap it for another token, or bridge it back to native Bitcoin whenever you choose.
