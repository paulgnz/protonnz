The Bloks.io tip bot for Telegram makes it easy to show off and gift your Proton NFTs directly in group chats. If you have collected NFTs on the Proton blockchain and want to share them with friends or tip them to community members, here is how to get set up.

## Linking Your Proton Account

Before you can use the tip bot, you need to connect your Proton wallet to your Telegram account.

1. Open Telegram and start a private chat with the **@BloksTipBot** bot.
2. Send the `/start` command. The bot will reply with instructions for linking your account.
3. Follow the provided link to authorize your Proton account through [Bloks.io](https://bloks.io). You will sign a transaction using your WebAuth.com wallet to prove ownership.
4. Once authorized, the bot will confirm that your Telegram account is linked to your Proton account name.

## Viewing Your NFTs

After linking, you can browse your NFTs directly in Telegram.

1. Send the `/nfts` command to the bot in a private message.
2. The bot will return a list of NFTs held in your linked Proton account, showing the collection name and asset ID for each one.
3. You can tap on individual NFTs to view their details, including the image, description, and template information.

If you have recently minted or purchased an NFT and it does not appear, wait a moment and try the command again. The bot pulls data from the blockchain, so there can be a brief delay.

## Tipping and Gifting NFTs

The real fun of the tip bot is sending NFTs to other people in Telegram groups.

1. In any Telegram group where the bot is active, reply to a message from the person you want to tip.
2. Use the command `/tipnft [asset_id]`, replacing `[asset_id]` with the ID of the NFT you want to send.
3. The bot will confirm the transfer and notify the recipient. If the recipient has not linked a Proton account yet, the bot will hold the NFT until they register.

You can also use the `/gift` command in a private chat with the bot to send an NFT to a specific Proton account name rather than a Telegram user.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Only NFTs on the Proton blockchain are supported. NFTs from other chains will not appear.
- Transfers through the tip bot are real on-chain transactions. Once sent, they cannot be reversed.
- Make sure you are tipping the correct asset ID, especially if you hold multiple NFTs from the same collection.

The Bloks.io tip bot is a simple way to bring your Proton NFTs into everyday conversations on Telegram, whether you are gifting art to a friend or rewarding a helpful community member.
