KuCoin is one of the major exchanges that lists the XPR token. If you hold XPR in your WebAuth.com wallet and want to deposit it to KuCoin for trading, the process is straightforward, but there is one critical detail you must not overlook: the memo field.

## Step 1: Get Your KuCoin Deposit Address and Memo

1. Log in to your [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com) account.
2. Go to **Assets > Main Account** and search for **XPR**.
3. Click **Deposit** next to the XPR listing.
4. Make sure the selected network is **Proton (XPR)**. Do not select any other network or your tokens may be lost permanently.
5. KuCoin will display two pieces of information: a **Deposit Address** (a Proton account name) and a **Memo** (a numeric string). Copy both of these exactly.

**Important:** The memo is required. KuCoin uses a single Proton account to receive deposits from all users, and the memo is what identifies your specific account. If you send XPR without the correct memo, your deposit may be lost or require a lengthy support process to recover.

## Step 2: Send XPR from WebAuth.com

1. Open your [WebAuth.com](https://webauth.com) wallet on your phone or in a browser.
2. Tap on your **XPR** balance, then tap **Send**.
3. In the **Recipient** field, paste the KuCoin deposit address you copied earlier.
4. In the **Memo** field, paste the numeric memo from KuCoin. Double-check that every digit is correct.
5. Enter the amount of XPR you want to deposit.
6. Review the transaction details carefully. Confirm that the recipient address and memo match what KuCoin provided.
7. Approve the transaction using your chosen authentication method (biometrics, PIN, or Yubikey).

The transaction should be confirmed on the Proton blockchain within a few seconds. One of the advantages of the Proton network is that transfers are feeless, so the full amount you send will arrive at KuCoin.

## Step 3: Verify the Deposit

1. Return to KuCoin and navigate to **Assets > Deposit History**.
2. You should see a pending deposit for XPR. KuCoin typically requires a small number of confirmations before the tokens are credited to your trading balance.
3. Once the deposit status shows as **Completed**, your XPR is ready to trade.

You can also verify the transaction independently by searching for your Proton account name on [Protonscan](https://protonscan.io) and reviewing your recent transfer history.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing or wrong memo:** This is the most common cause of lost deposits. Always copy the memo directly from KuCoin rather than typing it manually.
- **Wrong network:** If KuCoin offers multiple deposit networks for XPR, always select the Proton native network.
- **Sending to an old address:** KuCoin may change deposit addresses or memos. Always generate a fresh deposit address before each transfer to be safe.

By following these steps carefully, your XPR will arrive at KuCoin quickly and without fees, ready for trading.
