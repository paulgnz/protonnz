ProtonSwap is a decentralized exchange built on the Proton blockchain (now XPR Network) that offers fee-less token swaps. If you currently hold assets in MetaMask on the Ethereum network, you can bridge them over to Proton and take advantage of fast, zero-fee trading. This guide explains how to connect MetaMask, bridge your tokens, and start swapping.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following ready:

- **MetaMask** browser extension installed and configured with ETH or ERC-20 tokens
- A **WebAuth.com** wallet with a Proton account (see our WebAuth setup guide)
- Enough **ETH** in MetaMask to cover Ethereum gas fees for the bridge transaction

## Step 1: Navigate to the Proton Bridge

Open your browser and go to [protonswap.com](https://protonswap.com). Click on the **Bridge** tab in the navigation menu. The bridge interface allows you to transfer supported tokens between Ethereum and the Proton blockchain.

Select the direction of your bridge:

- **From:** Ethereum (MetaMask)
- **To:** Proton (your WebAuth account)

## Step 2: Connect MetaMask

Click the **Connect Wallet** button on the Ethereum side. MetaMask will open a popup requesting permission to connect to the site. Review the connection details and click **Connect**.

Once connected, your ETH balance and any supported ERC-20 token balances will be visible in the bridge interface.

## Step 3: Connect Your WebAuth Wallet

On the Proton side, click **Login** and select **WebAuth** as your wallet provider. Approve the connection in your WebAuth app. Your Proton account name will appear, confirming a successful link.

You now have both wallets connected to the bridge, which is required to transfer assets between the two chains.

## Step 4: Bridge Your Tokens

With both wallets connected, follow these steps to bridge:

1. Select the **token** you want to bridge (e.g., ETH, USDC, USDT)
2. Enter the **amount** you wish to transfer
3. Review the transaction summary, including any minimum amounts and estimated arrival time
4. Click **Bridge** to initiate the transfer
5. **Confirm** the transaction in MetaMask and pay the Ethereum gas fee

The bridge process typically takes between 5 and 15 minutes depending on Ethereum network congestion. You can track the status on the bridge page. Once completed, the wrapped tokens will appear in your WebAuth wallet.

## Step 5: Swap on ProtonSwap

With tokens now on the Proton side, navigate to the **Swap** tab on ProtonSwap:

1. Select the token pair you want to trade (e.g., XETH to XPR)
2. Enter the amount you wish to swap
3. Review the exchange rate and estimated output
4. Click **Swap** and approve the transaction in your WebAuth wallet

The swap executes instantly with zero transaction fees. This is one of the key advantages of using ProtonSwap over Ethereum-based DEXs where gas costs can be significant.

## Providing Liquidity

If you want to earn yield on your bridged assets, you can also provide liquidity on ProtonSwap:

1. Go to the **Pools** tab
2. Select a trading pair to provide liquidity for
3. Deposit an equal value of both tokens in the pair
4. Receive LP tokens representing your share of the pool

Liquidity providers earn a portion of the swap fees generated by the pool. You can withdraw your liquidity at any time.

## Important Notes

- Bridged tokens on Proton are wrapped versions of the original asset (e.g., ETH becomes XETH)
- Always double-check your destination Proton account name before bridging
- Keep some ETH in MetaMask for the return bridge if you plan to move assets back to Ethereum
- Bridge availability and supported tokens may change over time, so check the interface for the latest options

ProtonSwap combined with MetaMask bridging gives you a way to access fast, fee-less DeFi without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem entirely.
