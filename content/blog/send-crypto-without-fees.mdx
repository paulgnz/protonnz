If you have ever sent Bitcoin or Ethereum, you know the pain of transaction fees. Ethereum gas fees can spike to $50 or more during periods of high network congestion, and even Bitcoin transactions can cost several dollars. XPR Network takes a completely different approach: **all on-chain transactions are free**.

## How XPR Network Eliminates Gas Fees

XPR Network uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism instead of the energy-intensive Proof of Work model used by Bitcoin. Because block producers are elected by token holders rather than competing through mining, the network does not need to charge transaction fees to compensate miners. The result is instant, feeless transfers for every user on the network.

## Setting Up Your WebAuth.com Wallet

To get started sending free transactions, you need a WebAuth.com wallet:

1. **Download the app** from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com).
2. **Create an account** by choosing a unique @username. This becomes your human-readable wallet address.
3. **Secure your account** with biometric authentication (Face ID or fingerprint). WebAuth.com uses your device's secure enclave to store your private keys, so there is no seed phrase to worry about losing.
4. **Receive some XPR** to get started. You can purchase XPR directly in the app or receive it from another user.

## Sending XPR to Anyone with an @Username

Once your wallet is set up, sending crypto is as easy as sending a text message:

1. Open WebAuth.com and tap **Send**.
2. Enter the recipient's @username (for example, `@alice`).
3. Enter the amount of XPR you want to send.
4. Confirm with your biometric authentication.

The transfer settles in about half a second and costs absolutely nothing. No gas fees, no network fees, no hidden charges.

## Comparing With Ethereum Gas Fees

To put this in perspective, here is a quick comparison:

| Action | Ethereum | XPR Network |
|---|---|---|
| Simple token transfer | $5 - $50+ | $0 |
| Confirmation time | 15 seconds - minutes | ~0.5 seconds |
| Failed transaction cost | You still pay gas | N/A (free) |

On Ethereum, you pay gas even if your transaction fails. On XPR Network, there is no fee regardless of the outcome.

## Why This Matters

Zero-fee transactions open up use cases that are simply impractical on other blockchains. Micropayments, tipping, splitting a bill with friends, or paying for a coffee all become viable when there is no minimum economic threshold imposed by fees. For everyday users who want to send value as easily as sending an email, XPR Network removes the biggest barrier to adoption.
