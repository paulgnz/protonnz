WebAuth.com is the official wallet for the Proton blockchain (now XPR Network). It provides a secure, non-custodial way to manage your XPR tokens, interact with dApps, and send fee-less transactions. Unlike many crypto wallets, WebAuth uses biometric authentication and human-readable account names instead of long hexadecimal addresses. This guide covers everything you need to get up and running.

## Step 1: Download the App

WebAuth is available on multiple platforms:

- **iOS:** Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/webauth-com/id1594750450)
- **Android:** Download from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aspect.protonwallet)
- **Desktop:** Visit [webauth.com](https://webauth.com) to use the browser-based version

Install the app on your preferred device and open it to begin the setup process.

## Step 2: Create Your Account

Tap **Create Account** on the welcome screen. You will be asked to choose a unique username. This name serves as your wallet address on the Proton blockchain, so pick something memorable. Account names follow these rules:

- Must be exactly **12 characters** long
- Only lowercase letters (a-z) and numbers (1-5) are allowed
- No special characters or uppercase letters

For example, a username like `paulg.proton` or `mywalletname` would be valid formats. Once you confirm your chosen name, the app will generate your account on-chain.

## Step 3: Secure Your Account

WebAuth supports biometric authentication for fast and secure access:

- **Face ID / Touch ID** on iOS devices
- **Fingerprint / Face Unlock** on Android devices

Enable biometrics when prompted. This links a private key to your device's secure hardware, meaning your key never leaves the device and transactions are signed locally.

You will also be given the option to set a **PIN code** as a backup authentication method. Choose a strong PIN that you will remember.

## Step 4: Back Up Your Account

This is a critical step that should not be skipped. WebAuth provides a recovery phrase (private key backup) that allows you to restore your account if you lose access to your device.

1. Navigate to **Settings** within the app
2. Select **Backup Account** or **Export Private Key**
3. Write down the recovery information on paper and store it in a safe location
4. Never share your private key or recovery phrase with anyone

Without this backup, losing your device could mean permanent loss of access to your funds.

## Step 5: Fund Your Wallet

With your account created and secured, you can now receive tokens. Share your human-readable account name with the sender, or use the **Receive** tab to display a QR code. You can acquire XPR tokens through:

- Supported exchanges that list XPR
- Bridging assets from Ethereum using the Proton Bridge
- Receiving tokens from another WebAuth user

Once funded, you are ready to explore the Proton ecosystem, including ProtonSwap, ProtonMint, and staking through the wallet itself.

## Tips for Staying Safe

- Always keep your app updated to the latest version
- Enable all available security features including biometrics and PIN
- Never enter your private key on websites or share it in messages
- Verify transaction details in the app before approving any action

WebAuth makes managing your crypto straightforward and secure, with the added benefit of zero transaction fees on the Proton network.
