The Proton blockchain (now XPR Network) offers one of the most accessible platforms for minting NFTs. With zero gas fees and a user-friendly marketplace at [ProtonMint](https://protonmint.com), you can create, list, and sell digital collectibles without the costs typically associated with Ethereum-based platforms. This guide walks you through the entire process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

- A **WebAuth.com** wallet with a verified Proton account
- Some **XPR** tokens in your wallet for staking resources (a small amount is sufficient)
- Your artwork files ready to upload (supported formats include PNG, JPG, GIF, and MP4)

If you do not have a WebAuth wallet yet, download it from [webauth.com](https://webauth.com) and follow the account creation steps.

## Step 1: Connect to ProtonMint

Navigate to [protonmint.com](https://protonmint.com) and click the **Login** button in the top right corner. Select **WebAuth** as your login method. Your WebAuth wallet app will prompt you to approve the connection. Once authenticated, you will see your account name displayed on the site.

## Step 2: Create a Collection

Every NFT on Proton belongs to a collection. Think of a collection as a folder that groups related works together.

1. Click on your profile icon and select **My NFTs**
2. Navigate to the **Collections** tab and click **Create Collection**
3. Fill in the collection details:
   - **Collection Name:** A unique identifier (12 characters max, lowercase letters and numbers only)
   - **Display Name:** The public-facing name for your collection
   - **Description:** A brief summary of what the collection is about
   - **Collection Image:** A logo or banner image representing the collection
4. Set the **Market Fee** percentage, which is the royalty you earn on every secondary sale
5. Click **Create** and approve the transaction in your WebAuth wallet

## Step 3: Create a Schema

Schemas define the attributes your NFTs will have. Within your collection, create a new schema and add attribute fields such as:

- **name** (string) - the title of each NFT
- **image** (image) - the artwork file
- **description** (string) - a description of the piece
- **artist** (string) - the creator name

You can add custom attributes depending on what metadata you want attached to your tokens.

## Step 4: Mint Your NFT

With your collection and schema in place, you are ready to mint:

1. Go to your collection and click **Create NFT**
2. Select the schema you just created
3. Upload your artwork file
4. Fill in the attribute values such as name, description, and any custom fields
5. Set the number of editions (use 1 for a unique one-of-one piece)
6. Review the details and click **Mint**
7. Approve the transaction in WebAuth

Your NFT is now minted and visible in your collection. The entire process is fee-less thanks to the Proton blockchain's resource model.

## Step 5: List for Sale

To sell your freshly minted NFT on the marketplace:

1. Navigate to the NFT in your collection
2. Click **List for Sale**
3. Set your asking price in XPR or any other supported token
4. Confirm the listing

Your NFT will now appear on the ProtonMint marketplace where other users can discover and purchase it. Proton's fee-less transactions mean both buyers and sellers benefit from a smoother trading experience compared to gas-heavy alternatives.
