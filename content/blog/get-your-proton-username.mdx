One of the best features of XPR Network is human-readable wallet addresses. Instead of copying and pasting a long string of random characters, you get a simple @username that works like an email handle for crypto. Here is how to claim yours.

## Why Usernames Matter

On most blockchains, your wallet address looks something like this:

```
0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D
```

One wrong character and your funds are gone forever. There is no way to verify at a glance that you are sending to the right person. XPR Network solves this with human-readable accounts. Instead of that string of hex characters, your address is simply **@yourname** -- easy to read, easy to share, and easy to verify.

## Downloading WebAuth.com

WebAuth.com is the official wallet for XPR Network and the gateway to claiming your username:

1. **Download the app** from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android).
2. **Open the app** and tap **Create Account**.
3. **Set up biometric security.** WebAuth.com uses your device's Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint sensor to secure your account. Your private keys are stored in the device's secure enclave, meaning they never leave your phone.

## Choosing Your Username

During account creation, you will be prompted to choose your username. A few things to keep in mind:

- Usernames are **unique and permanent**. Once claimed, no one else can take it.
- They can contain **letters (a-z) and numbers (1-5)**, and must be **12 characters or fewer**.
- Choose something you will be comfortable sharing publicly, since this is the address people will use to send you crypto.
- Think of it like choosing an email address or social media handle. Short, memorable names are ideal.

## Benefits of Your @Username

Once your account is set up, your @username becomes your universal identity on XPR Network:

- **Send crypto** by telling someone your @name instead of a long address.
- **Receive payments** by simply sharing your @username. No QR codes required.
- **Sign in to dApps** like ProtonSwap, Proton Market, and other services built on the network, all using the same account.
- **Build reputation** as your transaction history and on-chain activity are tied to a recognizable name.

## Get Started

The entire setup process takes about two minutes. Download [WebAuth.com](https://www.webauth.com), pick your @username, and you are ready to send and receive crypto as easily as sending a message. Your username is your identity on the Proton blockchain -- claim a good one before someone else does.
